## Post Body

**Title:** Show HN: Narrative – Version control as a narrative medium

**Link:** https://github.com/jscraik/narrative

**Body:**

```
When you code with AI (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor), the rich context—your intent, the conversation, dead ends, reasoning—disappears. Your git commit only shows *what* changed, not *why*.

Narrative is a desktop app that captures the full story: AI sessions → intent → commits → timeline.

**Features:**
- 📖 Timeline view with session context, not just diffs
- 🤖 Import sessions from Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor
- 🔗 Link AI conversations to commits
- 🔍 Full-text search across all sessions
- 💾 Local-first (`.narrative/` folder in your repo)

**Tech stack:** Tauri v2 (Rust) + React + TypeScript

**Download:** macOS/Linux/Windows binaries in releases

Built this because I kept losing context across AI sessions. Would love feedback from anyone coding with AI assistants.
