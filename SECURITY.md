# Security Policy

| Latest release | Yes |

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do **not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting flow:

- [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/jscraik/narrative/security/advisories/new)

If private reporting is unavailable, contact the maintainer through the options listed on [@jscraik's GitHub profile](https://github.com/jscraik) and include:

1. Affected version and platform
2. Reproduction steps or proof-of-concept
3. Potential impact
4. Any suggested mitigation

## Response targets

- Initial acknowledgment: within 5 business days
- Triage decision: within 10 business days
- Fix timeline: depends on severity and complexity

We will coordinate disclosure timing with reporters whenever possible.
