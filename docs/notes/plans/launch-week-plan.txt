## Community Participation Strategy

### Phase 1: Listen and Learn (Days 1-7)

Don't promote yet. Just participate:

| Community | Action | Time |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Claude Code Discord | Answer questions, help others | 30 min/day |
| r/ClaudeAI | Comment on relevant posts | 20 min/day |
| r/cursor | Same as above | 20 min/day |

### Phase 2: Soft Mention (Days 8-14)

Mention Narrative only when relevant:
- "I've been working on something similar..."
- "I built a tool for this exact problem..."

### Phase 3: Direct Sharing (Days 15+)

Full promotion mode once you're a known community member.

## Metrics to Track

### Daily
- [ ] GitHub stars
- [ ] Downloads
- [ ] New issues
- [ ] Discord joins

### Weekly
- [ ] Active users (if you have telemetry)
- [ ] Retention (are people coming back?)
- [ ] Qualitative feedback (positive/negative themes)

### Targets

| Metric | Week 1 | Week 2 | Month 1 |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| GitHub stars | 20 | 50 | 100 |
| Downloads | 50 | 100 | 300 |
| Active users | 10 | 30 | 80 |
| Contributors | 0 | 1 | 3 |

## Content Calendar

### Week 1
- Day 1: Show HN post
- Day 2: Launch tweet thread
- Day 3: Behind-the-scenes: "Why I built Narrative"
- Day 4: Demo GIF
- Day 5: Week 1 learnings thread

### Week 2+
- 2-3 posts per week
- Mix of: demos, technical deep-dives, user spotlights
- Always respond to comments within 2 hours

---

## Pivot Triggers

**If Week 1 goes poorly:**

| Signal | Interpretation | Action |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| <20 stars | Low interest | Iterate on messaging |
| Only bug reports | Product-market fit issues | Focus on core value |
| "I don't get it" | Messaging unclear | Simplify pitch |
| "Why not just X?" | Competitive positioning | Differentiate better |

---

## Emergency Contacts

- HN front page: Be ready for server costs (should be fine, it's a desktop app)
- Negative comments: Don't argue, listen and learn
- Technical issues: Have rollback plan for releases

Good luck! 🚀
