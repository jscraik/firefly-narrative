## TL;DR

**The Problem**: When you code with AI (Claude, Codex, Cursor), you lose rich context—intent, dead ends, and reasoning. Git commits only show *what* changed, not *why*.

**The Solution**: Narrative captures the full story: AI sessions → intent → commits → timeline. It links your conversations to your code, preserving the thought process behind every line.

### Why Use Narrative?

|Feature|What It Does|
|---|---|
|**📖 Context-Aware Timeline**|Navigate commits with linked AI conversations, not just diffs.|
|**🤖 AI Integration**|Import sessions from Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Cursor.|
|**🔍 Atlas Search**|Find "that thing we discussed about caching" instantly across all sessions.|
|**💾 Local-First**|All data stays in your `.narrative` folder. No cloud needed.|

## Troubleshooting

### "App opens but is empty"

Click "Open repo" and select a valid git repository. If you have not selected a repo, Narrative waits for your input.

### "Import failed"

Check that your log files are in the supported JSON format. See [Documentation](docs/README.md) for detailed format specifications.

### "Build errors"

Run `pnpm install` again. Ensure your Rust toolchain is up to date (`rustup update`).
