# Evaluation Notes

## Scope

This repository does not run a production model service today. Track model/tooling regression only when model integrations are added.

## Procedure

1. Keep known-bad/known-good prompt list for agent/tool call paths.
2. Add evidence of regression checks when behavior changes in workflow automation.
3. Record any bypass with explicit exception and remediation date.
